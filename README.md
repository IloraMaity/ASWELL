# ASWELL
The MATLAB function provides, as output, the variation of the SES O3b MEO constellations over 24 time slots. 
In particular, the output is a cell that contains the adjacency matrix at each time slot. 
You can also set the capacity of the links with sat_bw and terr_bw values for the satellites and terrestrial links, respectively. 
The network is periodic, so after 24 time slots (15 minutes each one in the reality), the topology comes back to the situation of the first one. 

The simulated O3b MEO constellation details (location of ground stations and satellites) can be found at https://www.ses.com/our-coverage/teleport-map.
